    <h1>I was saying "Boo-urns."</h1>
    <div class="movie">
        <p>I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Human contact: the final frontier. Old people don't need companionship.
            They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted
            for our personal use.</p>
        <p>I'll be back. <strong> You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</strong>            <em> Marge, you being a cop makes you the man!</em> Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that,
            besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.</p>
        <h2>Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally"
            with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."</h2>
        <p>And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. I didn't get rich by signing checks. Marge, just about everything's
            a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.</li>
        <li>This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."</li>
        <li>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will
            be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people.</h3>
    <p>Please do not offer my god a peanut. Thank you, steal again. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And
        for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include
        hookers with a cold.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.</li>
        <li>Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention!</li>
        <li>Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot.</li>

    <p>I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children… Here's to alcohol,
        the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. Ahoy hoy? Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous
        mix.
    </p>
    <p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We
        live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't
        hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where
        was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm
        kidding. I work, I work.</p>
    <p>Ahoy hoy? I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on
        the streets, with all my criminal buddies. Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining
        down on Charlie.</p>
    <p>I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship.
        These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.</p>
    <p>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence,
        Stupid!" A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.</p>
    <p>You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Aaah! Natural light!
        Get it off me! Get it off me! What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?</p>
    <p>I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. Can't you people take the law into
        your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your
        fellow man?</p>
    <p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice
        to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold. Look out, Itchy! He's Irish!</p>
    <p>Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about! Attempted murder?
        Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair
        city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer?</p>
    <p>D'oh. Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last
        three "Highlander" movies. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.</p>
    <p>Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up
        in tragedy. I've had it with this school, Skinner. Low test scores, class after class of ugly, ugly children…</p>
